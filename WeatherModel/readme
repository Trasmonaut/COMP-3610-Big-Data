# Readme For Weather Model used

"dataCleaner.ipynb" is a cleaner to standardize the data as read from Website according to Lilly's collection/cleaning, to be used for weather prediciton.
Missing Precipiation data was filled in with the averages to avoid sqewing the data significantly, and to avoid removing null data from set.

Assume Temperature in Different reigions is the same, (example 59 C El Soccoro, 59 C Port of Spain). As such, only variable changing between regions is preciptation.
Precip column named after location, example Port of Spain precip mm
